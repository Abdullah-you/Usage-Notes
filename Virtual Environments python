python3 -m venv project_name (by convension project_name = venv)

example:
python3 -m venv venv

if we want to use already installed system packages we can use:
python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages   ---> it will include system pip packages also to the project

after this if we install any packages they will be in the venv just not in system
to check that:
pip list --local

Activation (after in project directory):
source venv/bin/activate

Deactivation:
deactivate

Delete environment:
rm -rf project_name/

every environment has its own packages and if we upgrade packages outside it'll not impact that project

after a project done and its requirements set we can export them so that
whenever a person uses that project can install them


so to create requirements:	pip freeze > requirements.txt
TO install requirements :	pip install -r requirements.txt


we shouldn't put any files in venv folder
all files should be in project directory not in venv
